    2.Food
    3.Computer
    4.Software
    5.Be early

2. Think about the idea
3. Design the technical side
4. Simpler finished game > broken good game
5. Headphone
6. Take break
7. Graphic Designer (if possible)
8. Placeholders
9. Bouffe santé
    -Sandwich
    -Fruit
    -Noix

12. 2D
13. When in doubt: No physics engine. No multiplayer. Square grid (as opposed to hexagons). K.I.S.S.
14. Occam's Razor: Aim for a smaller game that you hope to make. If you have extra time at the end you can add more features.
15. Stuck? Have a shower! The solution may come to you once you relax.
16. Don't over scope. Try to come up with a single unique focus. What might happen during your implementation process is that you'll discover new and interesting things worth exploring. That's good! You'll want to Explore the idea as much as possible and see what cool things come up.
17. Try to aim for a deadline that is 2 hours before the submission deadline
